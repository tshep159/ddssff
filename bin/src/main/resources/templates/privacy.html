You may post an issue to a municipality through the App.
At the time of posting you are required to find that particular municipality that you want to 
communicate with. Municipalities are identified by their provinces.  
                            
                            </span>

                        <li><span>

All the municipalities that you have posted on, you may receive communication, by email, call etc, 
where clarity is needed. Irrelevant issues will be deleted from the App and such users shall be noted and might not be 
able to use the App for a certain time.
